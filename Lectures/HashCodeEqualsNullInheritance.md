# Inheritance

## Review: HashCode
- Contract
    - if equal according to the equals() method -> hashcode should give the same hash
    - **unequal objects CAN have the same hash**

## Equals and HashCOde (null and shortcuts)
- Use ternary operators: ? 0: temp

## Inheritance
- Parent classes -> Can instantiate parent, 1 parent, and parents can hold data and implementation
- Interfaces -> cannot instantiate, implement data, cannot hold data and implementation
